For now, please see http://moonfall.org for docs

Included here is last version of Lua that was embedded, haven't tried
any newer versions yet.

Also included is the moonfall.org site which uses moonfall for its css
generation, with it running as a cgi script, however, this is
optional, but easier for development.
